# Nimg
## What is it?

**Nimg** is a CLI tool to create new images, fast and easy. No bloat, No bullshit.

## How do I use it?

Just run it from the command line, or from your fuck-ass file explorer, it does **not** matter.

Here's an example:

To create an image named nimg.png with the width 16 and height 32 you would run:

`nimg nimg.png.16x32.nimg`

## Why would I use it?

Maybe you make a shit-ton of images. Maybe you just hate opening GIMP, Aseprite, Photoshop, Paint for the 100th time. Either way, **Nimg** is your low-effort ticket to image creation. Use it if it clicks. Otherwise don't even bother
